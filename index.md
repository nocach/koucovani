# About
Hi, I'm Alexey Kaloshin, creator of FlowCatcher. Motivation for this project is simple - Spotify is great at providing access to enormous amount of music. What it lacks is support for pleasant experience of listening to such vast amount of tracks. 

FlowCatcher changes this in a couple of ways. It provides an easy way to perform some actions that are really cumbersome in default spotify player. User interface in FlowCatcher is a lot cleaner and helps to display only relevant information. Custom music Flows allow you to futher customize what and how you listen. You can combine and mix your tracks in a very specific and creative ways.  

I want this project to help people discover the best way for them to listen to their favorite music. I struggled with this for a long time. There are many tracks that I started to hate just because of how Spotify shuffle works. I stopped listening to some playlists because you can't easily mix something else to existing playlists. Now I can listen to my music library the way I want it. You can too.

# Requirements
FlowCatcher requires spotify account with premium subscription to work.

# What’s next
I want FlowCatcher to allow people listen to their music library the way they want. Next steps will be to add new sources, orders, mixers, filters, actions and their customization. In a distant future I want to create mobile version and provide means to synchronize data between multiple instances of application - that way you would be able to continue your flow everywhere. One of the most ambitious plans is to add support for other streaming services.
